### Take your tech to the Max!
------------------------------------------------------------

Whether it's conceptualizing, coming up with stories, or figuring out how to make day-to-day life easier; I am always driven by the idea of what could be. I've cultivated extensive leadership experience and customer service skills throughout my career across various industries. However, hobby game dev sparked my fascination with technology and its potential to take my ideas and build them into anything. My career goals are to eventually end up in DevSecOps or Cloud Security Engineer. 

Below you can see a list of projects I've worked on. If you have any questions or want to work on something together don't hesitate to connect with me.
