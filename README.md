### Take your tech to the Max!

I'm Max Barnes, and I am a creator at heart. Whether it's conceptualizing, coming up with stories, or figuring out how to make day-to-day life easier; I am always driven by the idea of what could be. I've cultivated extensive leadership experience and customer service skills throughout my career across various industries. However, hobby game dev sparked my fascination with coding and its potential to take my ideas and build them into anything.
