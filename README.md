### Take your work to the Max!
------------------------------------------------------------

I'm Max Barnes, and I am a creator at heart. Whether it's conceptualizing, coming up with stories, or figuring out how to make day-to-day life easier; I am always driven by the idea of what could be. I've cultivated extensive leadership experience and customer service skills throughout my career across various industries. However, my journey into creating video games as a hobby sparked my fascination with coding and its potential to take my ideas and build them into anything.

Below is a list of some of my personal projects. Not sure how long I can keep adding counter to their names but ill find a way. Im always looking to work as a group, so if you have any opportunities, dont hesitate to contact me! My email is: maxbarnes.dev@gmail.com.
